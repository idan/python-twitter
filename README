=Python Twitter=

_A python wrapper around the Twitter API_

Author: `DeWitt Clinton <dewitt@google.com>`

==Introduction==

This library provides a pure python interface for the Twitter API.

Twitter (http://twitter.com) provides a service that allows people to
connect via the web, IM, and SMS.  Twitter exposes a web services API 
(http://twitter.com/help/api) and this library is intended to make
it even easier for python programmers to use. 

  
==Building==

*From source:*

Download the latest python-twitter library from:

  http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/

Fetch the dependencies:

{{{
  $ easy_setup -U simplejson
}}}

Untar the source distribution and run:

{{{
  $ python setup.py test
  $ python setup.py install
}}}

==Getting the code==

  http://python-twitter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

Check out the latest development version anonymously with:

{{{
  $ svn checkout http://python-twitter.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ python-twitter
}}}

==Using==

The library provides a python wrapper around the Twitter API and
the twitter data model.

*Model:*

The two model classes are twitter.Status and twitter.User.  The
API methods return instances of these classes.  

To read the full API for twitter.Status or twitter.User, run:

{{{
  $ pydoc twitter.Status
  $ pydoc twitter.User
}}}

*API:*

The API is exposed via the twitter.Api class.

To create an instance of the twitter.Api class:

{{{
  >>> import twitter
  >>> api = twitter.Api()
}}}

To fetch the most recently posted public twitter status messages:

{{{
  >>> statuses = api.GetPublicTimeline()
  >>> print [s.user.name for s in statuses]
  [u'DeWitt', u'Kesuke Miyagi', u'ev', u'Buzz Andersen', u'Biz Stone'] #...
}}}

To fetch a single user's public status messages, where "user" is either
a Twitter "short name" or their user id.

{{{
  >>> statuses = api.GetUserTimeline(user)
  >>> print [s.text for s in statuses]
}}}

To fetch a list a user's friends:

{{{
  >>> users = api.GetFriends(username, password)
  >>> print [u.name for u in users]
}}}

To post a twitter status message:

{{{ 
  >>> status = api.PostUpdate(username, password, 'I love python-twitter!')
  >>> print status.text
  I love python-twitter!
}}}

There are more API methods, to read the full API documentation:

{{{
  $ pydoc twitter.Api
}}}

==Todo==
 
Patches and bug reports are welcome, just please keep the style
consistent with the original source.

Add more example scripts.

The twitter.Status and twitter.User classes are going to be hard
to keep in sync with the API if the API changes.  More of the 
code could probably be written with introspection.

Statement coverage of twitter_test is only about 80% of twitter.py.

The twitter.Status and twitter.User classes could perform more validation
on the property setters.

The ez_setup.py script should be upgraded to the latest version.  Waiting
until more distributions have packages for it.
